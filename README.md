A specialized JavaFX productivity application designed for technical support engineers to streamline note-taking, manage technical data, and generate formatted outputs for work-related tasks.
## Overview

`TSE-Notes` is a JavaFX-based application built to enhance productivity for technical support professionals. It provides an intuitive UI for capturing and organizing critical technical notes, including work orders, cases, serial numbers, parts, shipping information, and more. The app also features an integrated parts database for efficient part lookups and a powerful "stamp" feature that formats data into both HTML and plain text for easy copy-pasting into other systems.

### Key Features

- **Technical Note-Taking**  
  Capture and organize essential details such as:
    - Work orders (WO), cases, serial numbers, part orders, and parts
    - Shipping information and contact details of the person who called in
    - Customer contract type, entitlement, and service level
    - Detailed issue description, troubleshooting steps, and resolution notes

- **Integrated Parts Database**  
  Search and select parts by product range or global parts search, with a dedicated table to store and manage parts data.

- **Data Stamping**  
  Automatically organizes captured data into neatly formatted templates, available in both HTML and plain text formats. Easily copy-paste the output into other systems. Examples of stamps include:
    - Parts order tables
    - Shipping and contact information
    - Comprehensive templates combining all fields
